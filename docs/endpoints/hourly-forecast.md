## Response Characteristics

- **Rows:** Always 48
- **Update Frequency:** Hourly
- **Response Size:** ~8-10 KB
- **Query Time:** < 2 seconds
- **Time Interval:** 3600 seconds (1 hour) between rows
- **Worldwide Availability:** Yes

## Data Quality Notes

### Guaranteed Fields
All fields have values except:
- `wind_gust`: NULL when no gusts
- `rain_1h`: NULL when no rain expected
- `snow_1h`: NULL when no snow expected

### Precipitation Probability

`pop` (Probability of Precipitation):
- `0.0` = 0% chance (no rain)
- `0.5` = 50% chance
- `1.0` = 100% chance (certain rain)

**Important:** `pop` is a probability. `rain_1h` is actual expected volume.

### Time Validation

```sql
-- Verify hourly intervals
SELECT
  dt,
  (dt - LAG(dt) OVER (ORDER BY dt))/3600 as hours_between
FROM fdw_open_weather.hourly_forecast
WHERE lat = 52.52 AND lon = 13.405
LIMIT 10;
-- Expected: 1 hour between rows
```

### UV Index Interpretation

- `0-2`: Low
- `3-5`: Moderate
- `6-7`: High
- `8-10`: Very High
- `11+`: Extreme

## Common Use Cases

### Smart Irrigation Scheduling

```sql
-- Find best watering windows (no rain, moderate temp, low wind)
SELECT
  TO_TIMESTAMP(dt) AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' as time,
  ROUND(temp, 1) as temp_c,
  ROUND(pop * 100, 0) as rain_prob_pct,
  ROUND(wind_speed, 1) as wind_ms,
  CASE
    WHEN pop < 0.2
         AND temp BETWEEN 10 AND 30
         AND wind_speed < 5
         AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM TO_TIMESTAMP(dt)) BETWEEN 6 AND 9
      THEN '‚≠ê Optimal watering time'
    WHEN pop < 0.3 AND temp < 35
      THEN '‚úÖ Good watering time'
    WHEN pop > 0.5
      THEN '‚ùå Skip - rain expected'
    ELSE '‚ö†Ô∏è Acceptable'
  END as irrigation_recommendation
FROM fdw_open_weather.hourly_forecast
WHERE lat = 52.52 AND lon = 13.405
  AND dt <= EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM NOW() + INTERVAL '24 hours')::bigint
ORDER BY dt;
```

### HVAC Optimization

```sql
-- Predict heating/cooling needs
SELECT
  TO_TIMESTAMP(dt) AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' as time,
  ROUND(temp, 1) as temp_c,
  ROUND(feels_like, 1) as feels_like_c,
  humidity,
  CASE
    WHEN feels_like < 18 THEN 'Heating needed'
    WHEN feels_like > 24 THEN 'Cooling needed'
    ELSE 'Comfortable - no HVAC'
  END as hvac_mode,
  CASE
    WHEN feels_like < 18 THEN ROUND((18 - feels_like) * 0.5, 1)
    WHEN feels_like > 24 THEN ROUND((feels_like - 24) * 0.5, 1)
    ELSE 0
  END as estimated_load_kw
FROM fdw_open_weather.hourly_forecast
WHERE lat = 52.52 AND lon = 13.405
ORDER BY dt;
```

### Solar Power Forecasting

```sql
-- Estimate solar generation potential (simplified)
SELECT
  TO_TIMESTAMP(dt) AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' as time,
  clouds,
  uvi,
  CASE
    WHEN clouds < 20 AND uvi > 5 THEN 'High generation (80-100%)'
    WHEN clouds < 50 AND uvi > 3 THEN 'Good generation (60-80%)'
    WHEN clouds < 75 THEN 'Moderate generation (30-60%)'
    ELSE 'Low generation (<30%)'
  END as solar_forecast,
  -- Rough estimate: (100 - clouds) * uvi * 10 = watts per panel
  ROUND((100 - clouds) * uvi * 0.1, 0) as relative_output_pct
FROM fdw_open_weather.hourly_forecast
WHERE lat = 52.52 AND lon = 13.405
  AND EXTRACT(HOUR FROM TO_TIMESTAMP(dt)) BETWEEN 6 AND 20
ORDER BY dt;
```

## Caching Strategy

```sql
-- Create materialized view (refreshed hourly)
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_hourly_forecast_cache AS
SELECT *
FROM fdw_open_weather.hourly_forecast
WHERE lat = 52.52 AND lon = 13.405;

-- Refresh every hour
SELECT cron.schedule('refresh-hourly-forecast', '0 * * * *',
  'REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_hourly_forecast_cache');
```

**Benefits:**
- Reduces API calls from potentially 100s/day to 24/day
- Sub-millisecond query response
- Matches API update frequency

## Troubleshooting

### Unexpected NULL in rain_1h/snow_1h

This is **normal** - these fields are NULL when no precipitation expected. Check `pop` for probability.

```sql
-- Use COALESCE to handle NULLs
SELECT
  TO_TIMESTAMP(dt) AT TIME ZONE 'UTC' as time,
  ROUND(pop * 100, 0) as rain_prob_pct,
  COALESCE(ROUND(rain_1h, 2), 0) as rain_mm,
  COALESCE(ROUND(snow_1h, 2), 0) as snow_mm
FROM fdw_open_weather.hourly_forecast
WHERE lat = 52.52 AND lon = 13.405
LIMIT 5;
```

### Row Count Not 48

Should always return 48 rows. If not:
- Check API key validity
- Verify lat/lon parameters
- Check Supabase logs for errors

### Stale Forecast Data

Hourly forecast updates hourly. Check `dt` of first row - should be within 1-2 hours of current time.
